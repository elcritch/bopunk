For the current system a builddeb make rule is implemented which builds
a deb using distutils setup.py. 
See this article:
	http://ghantoos.org/2008/10/19/creating-a-deb-package-from-a-python-setuppy/

distutils might support bdist_deb in future revisions. See python bug:
	http://bugs.python.org/issue1054967
